Class [MLPClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier.html#sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier) implements a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) algorithm that trains using Backpropagation. MLPClassifier has many parameters to configure. The effects of some important parameters have been discussed in our lecture, e.g., activation functions, number of hidden layers, number of units in a hidden layer, gradient descent, regularization, etc. So, in this workshop we would like to empirically study these parameters.
